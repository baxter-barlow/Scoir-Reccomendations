# Scoir Reccomendation Viewer

With this python script, you'll be able to view teacher reccomendations without violating FERPA via the Scoir private API. It avoids violating FERPA by accessing client side HTTPS response data that is not shown on the web client.

# Installation and Use

After installing this repo, there are no additional requirements needed other than Python

To use the script, run the python file and enter the email and password associated with your Scoir account. 

The letters of reccomendation will then be outputted.

# Important Note

Some letters of reccomendation will not be shown. This is due to the way the teachers uploaded the reccomendation, thus this script will only access raw text inputted reccomendations
